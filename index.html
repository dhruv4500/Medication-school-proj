<h2>Information on Medication</h2>
<p>Today, there are more than 10 000 types of medical devices available. The selection of appropriate medical equipment <br>
   always depends on local, regional or national requirements; factors to consider include the type of health facility where<br>
   the devices are to be used, the health work force available and the burden of disease experienced in the specific catchment area. <br>
   It is therefore impossible to make a list of core medical equipment which would be exhaustive and/or universally applicable.</p>

  	<h2>Detail on Medical emergencies</h2>
  	<p>A medical emergency is an acute injury or illness that poses an immediate risk to a person's life or long-term health,<br>
  	 sometimes referred to as a situation risking "life or limb". These emergencies may require assistance from another person,<br>
  	 who should ideally be suitably qualified to do so, although some of these emergencies such as cardiovascular (heart), <br>
  	 respiratory, and gastrointestinal cannot be dealt with by the victim themselves. Dependent on the severity of the emergency<br>
  	 and the quality of any treatment given, it may require the involvement of multiple levels of care</p>

  	<h2> Details related to the procedure</h2>
  	<dl>
  		<dt>1. THE INTAKE ASSESSMENT PROCESS</dt>
  		<dd>As soon as someone arrives in the ER, the emergency staff gets to work, quickly performing a physical assessment<br>
  		 of the patient’s overall condition, checking symptoms, taking vitals, and reviewing medical history, including past <br>
  		 and present illnesses, allergies, and current medications or any medicine they may be taking. Of course, if the patient<br>
  		  is in critical condition, treatment will be started immediately and some of these assessments will occur simultaneously.<br>
</dd>

  	</dl>
  	 <dl>
  	<dt>2. PRE-SURGERY DIAGNOSTIC TESTING</dt>
  	<dd>After the patient has been stabilized and the intake assessment is finalized, diagnostic tests may be ordered. <br>
  		Diagnostic tests include:
  	<ul>
  	<li>Lab work and X-rays</li>
	<li>Computed tomography (CT) scans</li>
	<li>Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans</li>
	<li>Electrocardiograms (ECGs) for heart health</li>
	<li>Electroencephalograms (EEGs) for brain injury</li>

  	</ul>
  </dd>

  </dl>
  <dl>
<dt>3. FACILITATING AN EMERGENCY TRANSFER</dt>
<dd>While large hospitals accustomed to high volumes of traffic will have trauma or general surgeons on staff 24 hours a day, <br>
    small or rural hospitals may not have the staff nor the technical capabilities to perform surgery. In these cases, the smaller <br>
    facility will stabilize the patient and then coordinate a patient transfer to a larger facility.</dd>
  </dl>
<dl>
	<dt>4. UNDERGOING SURGERY</dt>

	<dd>Once the patient is unconscious, staff is properly dressed, and the area of the body being opened up is cleansed and <br>
	    surrounded by sterile drapes to prevent transmittal of germs, surgery begins. The nature and severity of the surgery will<br>
	    dictate who’s in the room, but in general, there is the surgeon, an assistant to the surgeon, a surgical technician, the <br>
	    anesthesiologist, and usually one or two nurses.</dd>

</dl>
  <dl>
  <dt>5. POST-EMERGENCY SURGERY RECOVERY</dt>

  <dd>During a patient’s recovery phase, their vital signs will be closely watched and pain medication and any other prescriptions <br>
      will be administered as needed. Some patients may need to remain on a ventilator, and others may require additional surgeries. <br>
      But, in general, once anesthesia has completely worn off patients are moved to a hospital room to begin the healing process;<br> those
      who are unstable or need more close attention will be transported to the intensive care unit (ICU).</dd>
